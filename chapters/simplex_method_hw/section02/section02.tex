\section{Minimization Puzzles}

\begin{puzzle}
    Minimize \( z = 6x_1 + 8x_2 \)

    subject to
    \begin{align*}
        2x_1 + 3x_2 & \geq 7 \\
        4x_1 + 5x_2 & \geq 9 \\
        x_1, x_2    & \geq 0
    \end{align*}
\end{puzzle}

\begin{puzzle}
    Minimize \( z = 5x_1 + 6x_2 + 7x_3 \)

    subject to
    \begin{align*}
        3x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 & \geq 10 \\
        4x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3 & \geq 12 \\
        x_1, x_2, x_3      & \geq 0
    \end{align*}
\end{puzzle}

\begin{puzzle}
    In the next two problems, convert each minimization problem into a maximization problem, the dual, and then solve by the simplex method.

    Minimize \( z = 4x_1 + 3x_2 \)

    subject to
    \begin{align*}
        x_1 + x_2   & \geq 10 \\
        3x_1 + 2x_2 & \geq 24 \\
        x_1, x_2    & \geq 0
    \end{align*}
\end{puzzle}

\begin{puzzle}
    A diet is to contain at least 8 units of vitamins, 9 units of minerals, and 10 calories. Three foods, Food A, Food B, and Food C are to be purchased. Each unit of Food A provides 1 unit of vitamins, 1 unit of minerals, and 2 calories. Each unit of Food B provides 2 units of vitamins, 1 unit of minerals, and 1 calorie. Each unit of Food C provides 2 units of vitamins, 1 unit of minerals, and 2 calories. If Food A costs \$1 per unit, Food B costs \$2 per unit and Food C costs \$3 per unit, how many units of each food should be purchased to keep costs at a minimum?

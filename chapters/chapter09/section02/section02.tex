\section{Bayes' Formula}
In this section you will learn to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find probabilities using Bayes' formula
    \item Use a probability tree to find and represent values needed when using Bayes' formula.
\end{enumerate}
In this section, we will develop and use Bayes' Formula to solve an important type of probability problem. Bayes' formula is a method of calculating the conditional probability \( P(F | E) \) from \( P(E | F) \). The ideas involved here are not new, and most of these problems can be solved using a tree diagram. However, Bayes' formula does provide us with a tool with which we can solve these problems without a tree diagram.
We begin with an example.

    Suppose a test is given to determine if a person is infected with HIV. If a person is infected with HIV, the test will detect it in 90\% of the cases; and if the person is not infected with HIV, the test will show a positive result 3\% of the time. If we assume that 2\% of the population is actually infected with HIV, what is the probability that a person obtaining a positive result is actually infected with HIV?
